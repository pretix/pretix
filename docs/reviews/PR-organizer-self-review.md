# PR Self-Review — UI Test: Organizer Creation - Sensoy Yasin

## What changed and why?
Added UI test for organizer creation flow to protect against regressions.

## Why is this the right test layer?
UI test verifies end-to-end organizer creation behavior.

## What could still break?
UI selector changes could break tests if frontend is updated.
