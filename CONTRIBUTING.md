Contributing to pretix
======================

Hey there and welcome to pretix!

We've got a contributors guide in [our documentation](https://docs.pretix.eu/en/latest/development/contribution/)
together with notes on the [development setup](https://docs.pretix.eu/en/latest/development/setup.html).

Please note that we have a [Code of Conduct](https://docs.pretix.eu/en/latest/development/contribution/codeofconduct.html)
in place that applies to all project contributions, including issues, pull requests, etc.
