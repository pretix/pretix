Android version support policy
==============================

Building software for Android always presents a struggle between keeping compatibility with older hardware to save cost
and utilizing feature of new Android versions to improve functionality, security and stability. To help you plan ahead,
we are publishing our intended schedule. This is to be understood as a minimum commitment, we will only drop support for
older versions if there is a technical reason to do so, not because the scheduled time has been reached.

.. warning:: This is a non-binding document. We will try our very best to not to deprecate support for Android versions
             earlier than listed here, but for technical or economical reasons, it might become necessary to do so under
             specific circumstances. Specifically, we might be forced to partially drop support for Android versions
             earlier where we integrate third-party components into our software. Typical examples would be specific
             payment terminal or printer types where we use a third-party component provided by the hardware vendor.

If we no longer support an Android version, it means that we will no longer publish new versions of the app supporting
that Android version. This means you are not getting new features or bug fixes, and at some point your app might stop
working with the pretix server.
