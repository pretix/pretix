Payment method overview
=======================

pretix allows you to accept payments using a variety of payment methods to fit the needs of very different events.
This page gives you a short overview over them and links to more detailed descriptions in some cases.

Payment methods are built as pretix plugins. For this reason, you might first need to enable a certain plugin at
"Settings" → "Plugins" in your event settings. Then, you can configure them in detail at "Settings" → "Payment".

If you host pretix on your own server, you might need to install a plugin first for some of the payment methods listed
on this page as well as for additional ones.

To get an overview of the officially supported payment methods and their pros and cons, head to the `pretix website`_.
On these pages, you get more information on how to configure :ref:`stripe`, :ref:`paypal`, and :ref:`banktransfer`.
