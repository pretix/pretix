PayPal
======

To integrate PayPal with pretix, you first need to have an active PayPal merchant account. If you do not already have a
PayPal account, you can create one on `paypal.com`_.
If you look into pretix' settings, you are required to fill in two keys:

Unfortunately, it is not straightforward how to get those keys from PayPal's website. In order to do so, you
need to go to `developer.paypal.com`_ to link the account to your pretix event.
Click on "Log In" in the top-right corner and log in with your PayPal account.

Then, click on "Dashboard" in the top-right corner.

In the dashboard, scroll down until you see the headline "REST API Apps". Click "Create App".

Enter any name for the application that helps you to identify it later. Then confirm with "Create App".

On the next page, before you do anything else, switch the mode on the right to "Live" to get the correct keys.
Then, copy the "Client ID" and the "Secret" and enter them into the appropriate fields in the payment settings in
pretix.

Finally, we need to create a webhook. The webhook tells PayPal to notify pretix e.g. if a payment gets cancelled so
pretix can cancel the ticket as well. If you have multiple events connected to your PayPal account, you need multiple
webhooks. To create one, scroll a bit down and click "Add Webhook".

Then, enter the webhook URL that you find on the pretix settings page. It should look similar to the one in the
screenshot but contain your event name. Tick the box "All events" and save.
