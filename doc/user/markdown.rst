Markdown Guide
==============

What is markdown?
-----------------

In many places of your shop, like frontpage texts, product descriptions and email texts, you can use
`Markdown`_ to create links, bold text, and other formatted content. Markdown is a good middle-ground
since it is way easier to learn than languages like HTML but allows all basic formatting options required
for text in those places.

Formatting rules
----------------

Simple text formatting
""""""""""""""""""""""

To set a text in italics, you can put it in asterisks or underscores. For example,

.. code-block:: markdown

    Please *really* pay your _ticket_.

will become:

    Please *really* pay your _ticket_.

If you set double asterisks or underscores, the text will be printed in bold. For example,

.. code-block:: markdown

    This is **important**.

will become:

    This is **important**.

You can also display, for example:

.. code-block:: markdown

    Input this `exactly like this`.

You will get:

    Input this ``exactly like this``.

Links
"""""

You can create a link by just pasting it in, e.g.

.. code-block:: markdown

    Check this on https://en.wikipedia.org

will become:

    Check this on https://en.wikipedia.org

However, if you want to control the text of the link, you can put the text of the link in ``[]`` brackets and the
link target in ``()`` parentheses, like this:

.. code-block:: markdown

    Check this on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org).

This will yield:

    Check this on `Wikipedia`_

All links created with pretix Markdown syntax will open in a new tab.

Lists
"""""

You can create un-numbered lists by prepending the lines with asterisks.

.. code-block:: markdown

    * First item
    * Second item with a text that is too long to
      fit in a line
    * Third item

will become:

    * First item
    * Second item with a text that is too long to
      fit in a line
    * Third item

You can also use numbers as list items

.. code-block:: markdown

    1.  Red
    2.  Green
    3.  Blue

to get

    1.  Red
    2.  Green
    3.  Blue

Headlines
"""""""""

To create a headline, prepend it with ``#`` for the main headline, ``##`` for a headline of the second level,
and so on. For example:

.. code-block:: markdown

    # Headline 1
    ## Headline 2
    ### Headline 3
    #### Headline 4
    ##### Headline 5
    ###### Headline 6

We do not recommend using headlines of the first level, as pretix will already set the name of your event as a level-1
headline of the page and HTML pages should have only one headline on the first level.

You can also use

.. code-block:: markdown

    *****

to create a horizontal line, like the following:

.. raw:: html

    <hr>

Using HTML
----------

You can also directly embed HTML code, if you want, although we recommend
using Markdown, as it enables e.g. people using text-based email clients
to get a better plain text representation of your text. Note however, that for
security reasons you can only use the following HTML elements::

    a, abbr, acronym, b, br, code, div, em, h1, h2,
    h3, h4, h5, h6, hr, i, li, ol, p, pre, span, strong,
    table, tbody, td, thead, tr, ul

Additionally, only the following attributes are allowed on them::

    <a href="…" title="…">
    <abbr title="…">
    <acronym title="…">
    <table width="…">
    <td width="…" align="…">
    <div class="…">
    <p class="…">
    <span class="…">

All other elements and attributes will be stripped during parsing.
