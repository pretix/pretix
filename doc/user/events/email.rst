===============

The settings at "Settings" â†’ "E-mail" allow you to customize the emails that pretix sends to the participants of your
event.

The page is separated into three parts: "E-mail settings", "E-mail content" and "SMTP settings". We will explain all
of them in detail on this page.

E-mail settings
---------------

The upper part of the page contains settings that are relevant for the generation of all e-mails alike. Those are
currently::

Subject prefix
    This text will be prepended to the subject of all e-mails that are related to your event. For example, if you
    set this to "dc2018" all subjects will be formatted like "[dc2018] Your payment was successful".

Sender address
    All e-mails will be sent with this address in the "From" field. If you use an email address at a custom domain,
    we strongly recommend to use the SMTP settings below as well, otherwise your e-mails might be detected as spam
    due to the `Sender Policy Framework`_ and similar mechanisms.

Signature
    This text will be appended to all e-mails in form of a signature. This might be useful e.g. to add your contact
    details or any legal information that needs to be included with the e-mails.

E-mail content
--------------

The middle part of the page allows you to customize the exact texts of all e-mails sent by the system automatically.
You can click on the different boxes to expand them and see the texts.

Within the texts, you can use placeholders that will later by replaced by values depending on the event or order. Below
every text box is a list of supported placeholders, but currently the following are defined (not every placeholder
is valid in every text):

============================== ===============================================================================
Placeholder                    Description
============================== ===============================================================================
event                          The event name
total                          The order's total value
currency                       The currency used for the event (three-letter code)
payment_info                   Information text specific to the payment method (e.g. banking details)
url                            An URL pointing to the download/status page of the order
invoice_name                   The name field of the invoice address
invoice_company                The company field of the invoice address
expire_date                    The order's expiration date
date                           The same as ``expire_date``, but in a different e-mail (for backwards
                               compatibility)
orders                         A list of orders including links to their status pages, specific to the "resend
                               link (requested by user)" e-mail
code                           In case of the waiting list, the voucher code to redeem
hours                          In case of the waiting list, the number of hours the voucher code is valid
============================== ===============================================================================

The different e-mails are explained in the following:

Placed Order
    This e-mail is sent out to every order directly after the order has been received, except if the order total
    is zero (see below). It should specify that/how the order is to be paid.

Paid Order
    This e-mail is sent out as soon as the payment for an order has been received and should give the customer
    more information on how to proceed, e.g. by downloading their ticket.

Free Order
    This e-mail is sent out instead of "Placed Order" and "Paid Order" if the order total is zero. It therefore should
    tell the same information, except asking the customer for completing their payment.

Resend link
    Sent by admin
        This e-mail will be sent out if you click the "Resend link" next to the e-mail address field on the order detail
        page. It should include the link to the order and can be sent to users e.g. if they lost their original e-mails.

    Requested by user
        Customers can also request a link to all orders they created using their e-mail address themselves by filling
        out a form on the website. In this case, they will receive an e-mail containing a list of all orders they created
        with the respective links.

Order changed
    This e-mail is sent out if you change the content of the order and choose to notify the user about it.

Payment reminder
    This e-mail is sent out a certain number of days before the order's expiry date. You can specify the number of days
    before the expiry date that this should happen and the e-mail will only ever be sent if you do specify such a
    number. The text should ask the customer to complete the payment, tell the options on how to do so and the
    consequences if no payment is received (ticket gone, depending on your other settings). You should also include
    a way to contact you in case of questions.

Waiting list notification
    If you enable the waiting list feature, this is the mail that will be sent out if a ticket is assigned to a person on
    the waiting list. It should include the voucher that needs to be redeemed to get the free spot and tell how long
    that voucher is valid and where to redeem it.

Order canceled
    This e-mail is sent to a customer if their order has been canceled.


Order custom mail
    You can use pretix' admin interface to directly send an e-mail with a custom text to the customer of a specific
    order. In this case, this will be the default text and might save you time by not having to re-type all of it every
    time.

Reminder to download tickets
    If you want, you can configure an email that will be send out a number of days before your event to remind
    attendees to download their tickets. The e-mail should include a link to the ticket download. This e-mail will only
    ever be sent if you specify a number of days.

SMTP settings
-------------

If you want to send your e-mails via your own e-mail address, we strongly recommend to use SMTP for this purpose.
SMTP is a protocol that is used by e-mail clients to communicate with e-mail servers. Using SMTP, pretix can talk to
your e-mail service provider the same way that e.g. the e-mail app on your phone can.

Your e-mail provider will most likely have a document that tells you the settings for the various fields to fill in
here (hostname, port, username, password, encryption).

With the checkbox "Use custom SMTP server" you can turn using your SMTP server on or off completely. With the
button "Save and test custom SMTP connection", you can test if the connection and authentication to your SMTP server
succeeds, even before turning that checkbox on.
