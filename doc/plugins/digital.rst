Digital content
===============

URL interpolation and JWT authentication
----------------------------------------

In the simplest case, you can use the digital content module to point users to a specific piece of content on some
platform after their ticket purchase, or show them an embedded video or live stream. However, the full power of the
module can be utilized by passing additional information to the target system to automatically authenticate the user
or pre-fill some fields with their data. For example, you could use an URL like this::

    https://webinars.example.com/join?as={attendee_name}&userid={order_code}-{positionid}

While this is already useful, it does not provide much security â€“ anyone could guess a valid combination for that URL.
Therefore, the module allows you to pass information as a `JSON Web Token`_, which isn't encrypted, but signed with a
shared secret such that nobody can create their own tokens or modify the contents. To use a token, set up a URL like this::

    https://webinars.example.com/join?with_token={token}

Additionally, you will need to set a JWT secret and a token template, either through the pretix interface or through the
API (see below). pretix currently only supports tokens signed with ``HMAC-SHA256`` (``HS256``). Your token template can contain
whatever JSON you'd like to pass on based on the same variables, for example::

    {
        "iss": "pretix.eu",
        "aud": "webinars.example.com",
        "user": {
            "id": "{order_code}-{positionid}",
            "product": "{product_id}",
            "variation": "{variation_id}",
            "name": "{attendee_name}"
        }
    }

Variables can only be used in strings inside the JSON structure.
pretix will automatically add an ``iat`` claim with the current timestamp and an ``exp`` claim with an expiration timestamp
based on your configuration.

API Resource description

The digital content plugin provides a HTTP API that allows you to create new digital content for your ticket holders,
such as live streams, videos, or material downloads.

The digital content resource contains the following public fields:
