Bank transfer HTTP API
======================

The banktransfer plugin provides a HTTP API that `pretix-banktool`_ uses to send bank
transactions to the pretix server. This API is integrated with the regular :ref:`rest-api`
and therefore follows the conventions listed there.

Bank import job resource
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Resource description
--------------------

The bank import job resource contains the following public fields:

.. rst-class:: rest-resource-table

                                                                 date

===================================== ========================== =======================================================

Note that the ``payer`` and ``reference`` fields are set to empty as soon as the payment is matched to an order or
discarded to avoid storing sensitive data when not necessary. The ``checksum`` persists to implement deduplication.

        "transactions": []
      }

   .. note:: Depending on the server configuration, the job might be executed immediately, leading to a longer API
             response time but a response with state ``completed`` or ``error``, or the job might be put into a
             background queue, leading to an immediate response of state ``pending`` with an empty list of
             transactions.

   :param organizer: The ``slug`` field of a valid organizer
   :statuscode 201: no error
   :statuscode 400: Invalid input
   :statuscode 401: Authentication failure
   :statuscode 403: The requested organizer does not exist **or** you have no permission to perform this action.
