Exhibitors
==========

The exhibitors plugin allows to manage exhibitors at your trade show or conference. After signing up your exhibitors
in the system, you can assign vouchers to exhibitors and give them access to the data of these vouchers. The exhibitors
module is also the basis of the pretixLEAD lead scanning application.

.. note:: On pretix Hosted, using the lead scanning feature of the exhibitors plugin can add additional costs
          depending on your contract.
