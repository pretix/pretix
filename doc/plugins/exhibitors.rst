Exhibitors
==========

The exhibitors plugin allows to manage exhibitors at your trade show or conference. After signing up your exhibitors
in the system, you can assign vouchers to exhibitors and give them access to the data of these vouchers. The exhibitors
module is also the basis of the pretixLEAD lead scanning application.

.. note:: On pretix Hosted, using the lead scanning feature of the exhibitors plugin can add additional costs
          depending on your contract.

The plugin exposes two APIs. One (REST API) is intended for bulk-data operations from the admin side, and one
(App API) that is used by the pretixLEAD app.

REST API
---------

The REST API for exhibitors requires the usual :ref:`rest-auth`.

Resources
"""""""""

The exhibitors plugin provides a HTTP API that allows you to create new exhibitors.

The exhibitors resource contains the following public fields:

App API
-------

The App API is used for communication between the pretixLEAD app and the pretix server.

.. warning:: We consider this an internal API, it is not intended for external use. You may still use it, but
             our :ref:`compatibility commitment <rest-compat>` does not apply.

Authentication
""""""""""""""

Every exhibitor has an "access code", usually consisting of 8 alphanumeric uppercase characters.
This access code is communicated to event exhibitors by the event organizers, so this is also what
exhibitors should enter into a login screen.

All API requests need to contain this access code as a header like this::

    Authorization: Exhibitor ABCDE123

Exhibitor profile
"""""""""""""""""

Upon login and in regular intervals after that, the API should fetch the exhibitors profile.
This serves two purposes:

* Checking if the authorization code is actually valid

* Obtaining information that can be shown in the app

The resource consists of the following fields:

Submitting a lead
"""""""""""""""""

After a ticket/badge is scanned, it should immediately be submitted to the server
so the scan is stored and information about the person can be shown in the app. The same
code can be submitted multiple times, so it's no problem to just submit it again after the
exhibitor set a note or a rating (0-5) inside the app.

On the request, you should set the following properties:

* ``code`` with the scanned barcode
* ``notes`` with the exhibitor's notes
* ``scanned`` with the date and time of the actual scan (not the time of the upload)
* ``scan_type`` set to ``lead`` statically
* ``tags`` with the list of selected tags
* ``rating`` with the rating assigned by the exhibitor
* ``device_name`` with a user-specified name of the device used for scanning (max. 190 characters), or ``null``

If you submit ``tags`` and ``rating`` to be ``null`` and ``notes`` to be ``""``, the server
responds with the previously saved information and will not delete that information. If you
supply other values, the information saved on the server will be overridden.

The response will also contain ``tags``, ``rating``, and ``notes``. Additionally,
it will include ``attendee`` with a list of ``fields`` that can be shown to the
user. Each field has an internal ``id``, a human-readable ``label``, and a ``value`` (all strings).

Note that the ``fields`` array can contain any number of dynamic keys!
Depending on the exhibitors permission and event configuration this might be empty,
or contain lots of details. The app should dynamically show these values (read-only)
with the labels sent by the server.

The request for this looks like this:

      "tags": ["foo"],
      "rating": 4,

    }
