Logging
=======

As pretix is handling monetary transactions, we are very careful to make it possible to review all changes
in the system that lead to the current state.

Logging changes
---------------

We log data changes to the database in a format that makes it possible to display those logs to a human, if
required. pretix stores all those logs centrally in a model called :py:class:`pretix.base.models.LogEntry`.
We recommend all relevant models to inherit from ``LoggedModel`` as it simplifies creating new log entries:

.. autoclass:: pretix.base.models.LoggedModel
   :members: log_action, all_logentries

To actually log an action, you can just call the ``log_action`` method on your object::

   order.log_action('pretix.event.order.cancelled', user=user, data={})

The positional ``action`` argument should represent the type of action and should be globally unique, we
recomment do prefix it with your packagename, e.g. ``paypal.payment.rejected``. The ``user`` argument is
optional and may contain the user who performed the action. The optional ``data`` argument can contain
additional information about this action.

Logging form actions
""""""""""""""""""""

A very common use case is to log the changes to a model that have been done in a ``ModelForm``. In this case,
we generally use a custom ``form_valid`` method on our ``FormView`` that looks like this::

    @transaction.atomic()
    def form_valid(self, form):
        if form.has_changed():
            self.request.event.log_action('pretix.event.changed', user=self.request.user, data={
                k: getattr(self.request.event, k) for k in form.changed_data
            })
        messages.success(self.request, _('Your changes have been saved.'))
        return super().form_valid(form)

It gets a little bit more complicated if your form allows file uploads::

    @transaction.atomic()
    def form_valid(self, form):
        if form.has_changed():
            self.request.event.log_action(
                'pretix.event.changed', user=self.request.user, data={
                    k: (form.cleaned_data.get(k).name
                        if isinstance(form.cleaned_data.get(k), File)
                        else form.cleaned_data.get(k))
                    for k in form.changed_data
                }
            )
        messages.success(self.request, _('Your changes have been saved.'))
        return super().form_valid(form)


Displaying logs
"""""""""""""""

If you want to display the logs of a particular object to a user in the backend, you can use the
following ready-to-include template::

   {% include "pretixcontrol/includes/logs.html" with obj=order %}

We now need a way to translate the action codes like ``pretix.event.changed`` into human-readable
strings. The :py:attr:`pretix.base.signals.logentry_display` signals allows you to do so. A simple
implementation could look like::

    from django.utils.translation import ugettext as _
    from pretix.base.signals import logentry_display

    @receiver(signal=logentry_display)
    def pretixcontrol_logentry_display(sender, logentry, **kwargs):
        plains = {
            'pretix.event.order.paid': _('The order has been marked as paid.'),
            'pretix.event.order.refunded': _('The order has been refunded.'),
            'pretix.event.order.cancelled': _('The order has been cancelled.'),
            ...
        }
        if logentry.action_type in plains:
            return plains[logentry.action_type]


Logging technical information
-----------------------------

If you just want to log technical information to a log file on disk that does not need to be parsed
and displayed later, you can just use Python's ``logging`` module::

   import logging

   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

   logger.info('Startup complete.')

This is also very useful to provide debugging information when an exception occurs::

   try:
      foo()
   except:
      logger.exception('Error when calling foo()')  # Traceback will automatically be appended
      messages.error(request, _('An error occured.'))
