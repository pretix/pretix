Coding style
============

Python code
-----------

* Basically: Follow `PEP 8`_.

  Use `flake8`_ to check for conformance problems. The project includes a setup.cfg file
  with a default configuration for flake8 that excludes migrations and other non-relevant
  code parts. It also silences a few checks, e.g. ``N802`` (function names should be lowercase)
  and increases the maximum line length to more than 79 characters. **However** you should
  still name all your functions lowercase [#f1]_ and keep your lines short when possible.

* Our build server will reject all code violating other flake8 checks than the following:

  * E123: closing bracket does not match indentation of opening bracketâ€™s line
  * F403: ``from module import *`` used; unable to detect undefined names
  * F401: module imported but unused
  * N802: function names should be lowercase

 So please make sure that you *always* follow all other rules and break these rules *only when
 it makes sense*.

* Use ``isort -rc pretix`` in the source directory to order your imports.

* Indent your code with four spaces.

* For templates and models, follow the `Django Coding Style`_.

* Use Django's class-based views

* Always mark all strings ever displayed to any user for translation.
