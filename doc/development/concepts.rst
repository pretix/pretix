Concepts and Terminology
========================

The components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The project pretix is split into several components. The main components are:

**base**
    This is the foundation below all other components. It is primarily
    responsible for the data structures and database communication. It also hosts
    several utilities which are used by multiple other components and important parts of
    the business logic.

**control**
    This is the web-based backend software which allows organizers to
    create and manage their events, items, orders and tickets.

**presale**
    This is the ticket-shop itself, containing all of the parts visible to the
    end user. Also called "frontend" in parts of this documentation.

**api**
    A RESTful API exposed to integrate with third-party software.

**plugins**
    A set of pretix plugins that ship bundled with pretix.

Users and events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

pretix is all about **events**, which are defined as something happening somewhere.
Every event is managed by the **organizer**, an abstract entity running the event.

pretix has a concept of **users** that is used for all people who have to log in to the
control panel to manage one or more events. No user is required to place an order.


Items and variations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The purpose of pretix is to sell products, e.g. tickets or merchandise for an event. Internally,
those products are called **items**. An item can have multiple **variations**. For example,
the item 'T-Shirt' could have the **variations** 'S', 'M' and 'L'.

An item can be extended using **questions**. Questions enable items to be extended by
additional information which can be entered by the user. Examples of possible questions
include 'name' or 'age'.

Quotas
^^^^^^

Every item needs to belong to one or more **quotas**. The quota contains the information on how many
times an item can be sold. A quota can have a limited amount of tickets (e.g. if you have a room that
fits a defined maximum number of persons) or it can be unlimited. In the former case, the quota can be
available or sold out, in the latter case it is always treated as available.

If an item is assigned to multiple quotas, it can only be bought if *all of them* still are available.
If multiple items are assigned to the same quota, the quota will be counted as sold out as soon as the
*sum* of the two items exceeds the quota limit.

The availability of a quota is currently calculated by subtracting the following numbers from the quota
limit:

* The number of orders placed for an item that are either already paid or within their granted payment period
* The number of non-expired items currently in the shopping cart of users
* The number of vouchers defined as "quota blocking" (see blow)
* The number of people on the waiting list

The quota system tries very hard to be as friendly as possible to your event attendees while still making sure
your limit is never exceeded. For  example, when the payment period of an order expires without the order being
paid for, the quota will be freed to allow new persons to buy a ticket. However, if you then receive a payment
for the expired order, it will be accepted â€“ unless the quota has sold out in the meantime.

Vouchers
^^^^^^^^

A voucher is an object that can be used to grant a single user something special, e.g. a reduced price for a
product or reserved quota space.

Orders
^^^^^^

If a customer completes the checkout process, an **Order** will be created containing all the entered information.
An order can be in one of currently five states that are listed in the diagram below:
