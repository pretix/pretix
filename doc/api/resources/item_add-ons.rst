Item add-ons
=====

Resource description
--------------------

With add-ons, you can specify products that can be bought as an addition to this specific product. For example, if you
host a conference with a base conference ticket and a number of workshops, you could define the workshops as add-ons to
the conference ticket. With this configuration, the workshops cannot be bought on their own but only in combination with
a conference ticket. You can here specify categories of products that can be used as add-ons to this product. You can
also specify the minimum and maximum number of add-ons of the given category that can or need to be chosen. The user can
buy every add-on from the category at most once. If an add-on product has multiple variations, only one of them can be
bought.
The add-ons resource contains the following public fields:
