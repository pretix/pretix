Check-in
========

This page describes special APIs built for ticket scanning apps. For managing check-in configuration or other operations,
please also see :ref:`rest-checkinlists`. The check-in list API also contains endpoints to obtain statistics or log
failed scans.

.. versionchanged:: 4.12

    The endpoints listed on this page have been added.

.. versionchanged:: 4.18

    The ``source_type`` parameter has been added.

.. _`rest-checkin-redeem`:

Checking a ticket in
--------------------

.. http:post:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/checkinrpc/redeem/

   Tries to redeem an order position, i.e. checks the attendee in (or out). This is the recommended endpoint to use
   if you build any kind of scanning app that performs check-ins for scanned barcodes. It is safe to use with untrusted
   inputs in the ``secret`` field.

   This endpoint supports passing multiple check-in lists to perform a multi-event scan. However, each check-in list
   passed needs to be from a distinct event.

   :<json string secret: Scanned QR code corresponding to the ``secret`` attribute of a ticket.
   :<json string source_type: Type of source the ``secret`` was obtained form. Defaults to ``"barcode"``.
   :<json array lists: List of check-in list IDs to search on. No two check-in lists may be from the same event.
   :<json string type: Send ``"exit"`` for an exit and ``"entry"`` (default) for an entry.
   :<json datetime datetime: Specifies the datetime of the check-in. If not supplied, the current time will be used.
   :<json boolean force: Specifies that the check-in should succeed regardless of revoked barcode, previous check-ins or required
                         questions that have not been filled. This is usually used to upload offline scans that already happened,
                         because there's no point in validating them since they happened whether they are valid or not. Defaults to ``false``.
   :<json boolean questions_supported: When this parameter is set to ``true``, handling of questions is supported. If
                                       you do not implement question handling in your user interface, you **must**
                                       set this to ``false``. In that case, questions will just be ignored. Defaults
                                       to ``true``.
   :<json boolean ignore_unpaid: Specifies that the check-in should succeed even if the order is in pending state.
                                 Defaults to ``false`` and only works when ``include_pending`` is set on the check-in
                                 list.
   :<json object answers: If questions are supported/required, you may/must supply a mapping of question IDs to their
                          respective answers. The answers should always be strings. In case of (multiple-)choice-type
                          answers, the string should contain the (comma-separated) IDs of the selected options.
   :<json string nonce: You can set this parameter to a unique random value to identify this check-in. If you're sending
                        this request twice with the same nonce, the second request will also succeed but will always
                        create only one check-in object even when the previous request was successful as well. This
                        allows for a certain level of idempotency and enables you to re-try after a connection failure.
   :>json string status: ``"ok"``, ``"incomplete"``, or ``"error"``
   :>json string reason: Reason code, only set on status ``"error"``, see below for possible values.
   :>json string reason_explanation: Human-readable explanation, only set on status ``"error"`` and reason ``"rules"``, can be null.
   :>json object position: Copy of the matching order position (if any was found). The contents are the same as the
                           :ref:`order-position-resource`, with the following differences: (1) The ``checkins`` value
                           will only include check-ins for the selected list. (2) An additional boolean property
                           ``require_attention`` will inform you whether either the order or the item have the
                           ``checkin_attention`` flag set. (3) If ``attendee_name`` is empty, it may automatically fall
                           back to values from a parent product or from invoice addresses.
   :>json boolean require_attention: Whether or not the ``require_attention`` flag is set on the item or order.
   :>json list checkin_texts: List of additional texts to show to the user.
   :>json object list: Excerpt of information about the matching :ref:`check-in list <rest-checkinlists>` (if any was found),
                       including the attributes ``id``, ``name``, ``event``, ``subevent``, and ``include_pending``.
   :>json object questions: List of questions to be answered for check-in, only set on status ``"incomplete"``.

        },
        "position": {
          …
        }
      }

   Possible error reasons:

   * ``invalid`` - Ticket is not known.
   * ``unpaid`` - Ticket is not paid for.
   * ``blocked`` - Ticket has been blocked.
   * ``invalid_time`` - Ticket is not valid at this time.
   * ``canceled`` – Ticket is canceled or expired.
   * ``already_redeemed`` - Ticket already has been redeemed.
   * ``product`` - Tickets with this product may not be scanned at this device.
   * ``rules`` - Check-in prevented by a user-defined rule.
   * ``ambiguous`` - Multiple tickets match scan, rejected.
   * ``revoked`` - Ticket code has been revoked.
   * ``error`` - Internal error.

   In case of reason ``rules`` and ``invalid_time``, there might be an additional response field ``reason_explanation``
   with a human-readable description of the violated rules. However, that field can also be missing or be ``null``.

   :param organizer: The ``slug`` field of the organizer to fetch
   :statuscode 201: no error
   :statuscode 400: Invalid or incomplete request, see above
   :statuscode 401: Authentication failure
   :statuscode 403: The requested organizer/event does not exist **or** you have no permission to view this resource.

Performing a ticket search
--------------------------

.. http:get:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/checkinrpc/search/

   Returns a list of all order positions matching a given search request. The result is the same as
   the :ref:`order-position-resource`, with the following differences:

   * The ``checkins`` value will only include check-ins for the selected list.

   * An additional boolean property ``require_attention`` will inform you whether either the order or the item
     have the ``checkin_attention`` flag set.

   * If ``attendee_name`` is empty, it will automatically fall back to values from a parent product or from invoice
     addresses.

   This endpoint supports passing multiple check-in lists to perform a multi-event search. However, each check-in list
   passed needs to be from a distinct event.
