   according endpoint has to be used.

   :query integer page: The page number in case of a multi-page result set, default is 1.
   :query string zone_name: Only show seats with the given zone_name.
   :query string row_name: Only show seats with the given row_name.

   :query boolean blocked: Only show seats with the given blocked status.
   :query boolean is_available: Only show seats that are (not) currently available.
   :query string expand: If you pass ``"orderposition"``, ``"cartposition"``, or ``"voucher"``, the respective field will be
                         shown as a nested value instead of just an ID. This requires permission to access that object.
                         The nested objects are identical to the respective resources, except that order positions
                         will have an attribute of the format ``"order": {"code": "ABCDE", "event": "eventslug"}`` to make
                         matching easier, and won't include the `seat` attribute, as that would be redundant.
                         The parameter can be given multiple times.
