Scheduled data exports
======================

pretix and it's plugins include a number of data exporters that allow you to bulk download various data from pretix in
different formats. You should read :ref:`rest-exporters` first to get an understanding of the basic mechanism.

Exports can be scheduled to be sent at specific times automatically, both on organizer level and event level.

Scheduled export resource
-------------------------

The scheduled export contains the following public fields:

.. rst-class:: rest-resource-table

                                                                 to access at the time of the export. **We consider this

Special notes on permissions
----------------------------

Permission handling for scheduled exports is more complex than for most other objects. The reason for this is that
there are two levels of access control involved here: First, you need permission to access or change the configuration
of the scheduled exports in the moment you are doing it. Second, you **continuously** need permission to access the
**data** that is exported as part of the schedule. For this reason, scheduled exports always need one user account
to be their **owner**.

Therefore, scheduled exports **must** be created by an API client using :ref:`OAuth authentication <rest-oauth>`.
It is impossible to create a scheduled export using token authentication. After the export is created, it can also be
modified using token authentication.

A user or token with the "can change settings" permission for a given organizer or event can see and change
**all** scheduled exports created for the respective organizer or event, regardless of who created them.
A user without this permission can only see **their own** scheduled exports.
A token without this permission can not see scheduled exports as all.

.. http:patch:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/scheduled_exports/(id)/

   Update a scheduled export. You can also use ``PUT`` instead of ``PATCH``. With ``PUT``, you have to provide all fields of

   want to change.
