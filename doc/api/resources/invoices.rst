.. versionchanged:: 1.6

   The attribute ``invoice_no`` has been dropped in favor of ``number`` which includes the number including the prefix,
   since the prefix can now vary. Also, invoices now need to be identified by their ``number`` instead of the raw
   number.


.. versionchanged:: 1.7

   The attributes ``lines.tax_name``, ``foreign_currency_display``, ``foreign_currency_rate``, and
   ``foreign_currency_rate_date`` have been added.


.. versionchanged:: 1.9

   The attribute ``internal_reference`` has been added.
