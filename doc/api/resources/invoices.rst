Transmission types
------------------

pretix supports multiple ways to transmit an invoice from the organizer to the invoice recipient.
For each transmission type, different fields are supported in the ``transmission_info`` object of the
invoice address. Currently, pretix supports the following transmission types:

Email
"""""

The identifier ``"email"`` represents the transmission of PDF invoices through email.
This is the default transmission type in pretix and has some special behavior for backwards compatibility.
Transmission is always executed through the provider ``"email_pdf"``.
The ``transmission_info`` object may contain the following properties:

.. rst-class:: rest-resource-table

===================================== ========================== =======================================================
Field                                 Type                       Description
===================================== ========================== =======================================================
transmission_email_address            string                     Optional. An email address other than the order address
                                                                 that the invoice should be sent to.
                                                                 Business customers only.
===================================== ========================== =======================================================

PEPPOL
""""""

The identifier ``"peppol"`` represents the transmission of XML invoices through the `PEPPOL`_ network.
This is only available for business addresses.
This is not supported by pretix out of the box and requires the use of a suitable plugin.
The ``transmission_info`` object may contain the following properties:

.. rst-class:: rest-resource-table

===================================== ========================== =======================================================
Field                                 Type                       Description
