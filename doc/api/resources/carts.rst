Cart positions
==============

The API provides limited access to the cart position data model. This API currently only allows creating and deleting
cart positions to reserve quota.

The cart position resource contains the following public fields:

.. http:post:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/events/(event)/cartpositions/

   Creates a new cart position.

   .. warning:: This endpoint is considered **experimental**. It might change at any time without prior notice.

   .. warning::

       This endpoint is intended for advanced users. It is not designed to be used to build your own shop frontend.
       There is a lot that it does not or can not do, and you will need to be careful using it.
       It allows to bypass many of the restrictions imposed when creating a cart through the
       regular shop.

       Specifically, this endpoint currently

       * does not validate if products are only to be sold in a specific time frame

       * does not validate if the event's ticket sales are already over or haven't started

       * does not support add-on products at the moment

       * does not check or calculate prices but believes any prices you send

       * does not support the redemption of vouchers

       * does not prevent you from buying items that can only be bought with a voucher

       * does not support file upload questions

   You can supply the following fields of the resource:

   * ``cart_id`` (optional, needs to end in ``@api``)
   * ``item``
   * ``variation`` (optional)
   * ``price``
   * ``seat`` (The ``seat_guid`` attribute of a seat. Required when the specified ``item`` requires a seat, otherwise must be ``null``.)
   * ``attendee_name`` **or** ``attendee_name_parts`` (optional)
   * ``attendee_email`` (optional)
   * ``subevent`` (optional)
   * ``expires`` (optional)
   * ``includes_tax`` (optional)
   * ``answers``

      * ``question``
      * ``answer``
      * ``options``

   **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      POST /api/v1/organizers/bigevents/events/sampleconf/cartpositions/ HTTP/1.1
      Host: pretix.eu
      Accept: application/json, text/javascript
      Content: application/json

      {
        "item": 1,
        "variation": null,
        "price": "23.00",
        "attendee_name_parts": {
          "given_name": "Peter",
          "family_name": "Miller"
        },
        "attendee_email": null,
        "answers": [
          {
            "question": 1,
            "answer": "23",
            "options": []
          }
        ],

         order.
