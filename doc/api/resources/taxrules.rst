Tax codes
---------

For integration with external systems, such as electronic invoicing or bookkeeping systems, the tax rate itself is often
not sufficient information. For example, there could be many different reasons why a sale has a tax rate of 0 %, but the
external handling of the transaction depends on which reason applies. Therefore, pretix allows to supply a codified
reason that allows us to understand what the specific legal situation is. These tax codes are modeled after a combination
of the code lists from the European standard EN16931 and the German standard DSFinV-K.

The following codes are supported:

- ``S/standard`` -- Standard VAT rate in the merchant country
- ``S/reduced`` -- Reduced VAT rate in the merchant country
- ``S/averaged`` -- Averaged VAT rate in the merchant country (known use case: agricultural businesses in Germany)
- ``AE`` -- Reverse charge
- ``O`` -- Services outside of scope of tax
- ``E`` -- Exempt from tax (no reason given)
- ``E/<reason>`` -- Exempt from tax, where ``<reason>`` is one of the codes listed in the `VATEX code list`_ version 5.0.
- ``Z`` -- Zero-rated goods
- ``G`` -- Free export item, VAT not charged
- ``K`` -- VAT exempt for EEA intra-community supply of goods and services
- ``L`` -- Canary Islands general indirect tax
- ``M`` -- Tax for production, services and importation in Ceuta and Melilla
- ``B`` -- Transferred (VAT), only in Italy

The code set in the ``code`` attribute of the tax rule is used by default. When ``eu_reverse_charge`` is active, the
code is replaced by ``AE`` for reverse charge sales and by ``O`` for non-EU sales. When configuring custom rules, you
should actively set a ``"code"`` key on each rule. Only for ``"action": "reverse"`` we automatically apply the code
``AE``, in all other cases the default ``code`` of the tax rule is selected.
