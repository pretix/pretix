.. http:patch:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/giftcards/(id)/

   Update a gift card. You can also use ``PUT`` instead of ``PATCH``. With ``PUT``, you have to provide all fields of
   the resource, other fields will be reset to default. With ``PATCH``, you only need to provide the fields that you
   want to change.

   You can change all fields of the resource except the ``id``, ``secret``, ``testmode``, and ``currency`` fields. Be
   careful when modifying the ``value`` field to avoid race conditions. We recommend to use the ``transact`` method
   described below.

   **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      PATCH /api/v1/organizers/bigevents/giftcards/1/ HTTP/1.1
      Host: pretix.eu
