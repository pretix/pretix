                           ``last_modified``, and ``status``. Default: ``datetime``
   :query string code: Only return orders that match the given order code
   :query string status: Only return orders in the given order status (see above)
   :query string search: Only return orders matching a given search query (matching for names, email addresses, and company names)
   :query string customer: Only show orders linked to the given customer.
   :query integer item: Only return orders with a position that contains this item ID. *Warning:* Result will also include orders if they contain mixed items, and it will even return orders where the item is only contained in a canceled position.
   :query integer variation: Only return orders with a position that contains this variation ID. *Warning:* Result will also include orders if they contain mixed items and variations, and it will even return orders where the variation is only contained in a canceled position.
   :query boolean testmode: Only return orders with ``testmode`` set to ``true`` or ``false``
   :query boolean require_approval: If set to ``true`` or ``false``, only categories with this value for the field
                                    ``require_approval`` will be returned.
   :query include_canceled_positions: If set to ``true``, the output will contain canceled order positions. Note that this
                                      only affects position-level cancellations, not fully-canceled orders.
   :query include_canceled_fees: If set to ``true``, the output will contain canceled order fees.
   :query string email: Only return orders created with the given email address
   :query string locale: Only return orders with the given customer locale
   :query datetime modified_since: Only return orders that have changed since the given date. Be careful: We only
       recommend using this in combination with ``testmode=false``, since test mode orders can vanish at any time and
       you will not notice it using this method.
   :query datetime created_since: Only return orders that have been created since the given date.
   :query integer subevent: Only return orders with a position that contains this subevent ID. *Warning:* Result will also include orders if they contain mixed subevents, and it will even return orders where the subevent is only contained in a canceled position.
   :query datetime subevent_after: Only return orders that contain a ticket for a subevent taking place after the given date. This is an exclusive after, and it considers the **end** of the subevent (or its start, if the end is not set).
   :query datetime subevent_before: Only return orders that contain a ticket for a subevent taking place after the given date. This is an exclusive before, and it considers the **start** of the subevent.
   :query string exclude: Exclude a field from the output, e.g. ``fees`` or ``positions.downloads``. Can be used as a performance optimization. Can be passed multiple times.
   :query string include: Include only the given field in the output, e.g. ``fees`` or ``positions.downloads``. Can be used as a performance optimization. Can be passed multiple times. ``include`` is applied before ``exclude``, so ``exclude`` takes precedence.

.. http:get:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/orders/

   Returns a list of all orders within all events of a given organizer (with sufficient access permissions).

   Supported query parameters and output format of this endpoint are identical to the list endpoint within an event,
   with the exception that the ``pdf_data`` parameter is not supported here.

Order ticket download
---------------------

.. versionchanged:: 4.10

   The API now supports ticket downloads for pending orders if allowed by the event settings.

.. http:get:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/events/(event)/orders/(code)/download/(output)/

   Download tickets for an order, identified by its order code. Depending on the chosen output, the response might
   be a ZIP file, PDF file or something else. The order details response contains a list of output options for this
   particular order.

   Tickets can only be downloaded if ticket downloads are active and – depending on event settings – the order is either paid or pending. Note that in some cases the
   ticket file might not yet have been created. In that case, you will receive a status code :http:statuscode:`409` and
   you are expected to retry the request after a short period of waiting.

   **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      GET /api/v1/organizers/bigevents/events/sampleconf/orders/ABC12/download/pdf/ HTTP/1.1
      Host: pretix.eu
      Accept: application/json, text/javascript

   **Example response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Vary: Accept
      Content-Type: application/pdf

      ...

   :param organizer: The ``slug`` field of the organizer to fetch
   :param event: The ``slug`` field of the event to fetch
   :param code: The ``code`` field of the order to fetch
   :param output: The internal name of the output provider to use
   :statuscode 200: no error
   :statuscode 401: Authentication failure
   :statuscode 403: The requested organizer/event does not exist **or** you have no permission to view this resource
                    **or** downloads are not available for this order at this time. The response content will
                    contain more details.
   :statuscode 404: The requested order or output provider does not exist.
   :statuscode 409: The file is not yet ready and will now be prepared. Retry the request after waiting for a few
                          seconds.

Updating order fields
---------------------

Creating orders
---------------

.. http:post:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/events/(event)/orders/

   Creates a new order.

   .. warning::

       This endpoint is intended for advanced users. It is not designed to be used to build your own shop frontend,
       it's rather intended to import attendees from external sources etc.
       There is a lot that it does not or can not do, and you will need to be careful using it.
       It allows to bypass many of the restrictions imposed when creating an order through the
       regular shop.

       Specifically, this endpoint currently

       * does not validate if products are only to be sold in a specific time frame

       * does not validate if products are only to be sold on other sales channels

       * does not validate if the event's ticket sales are already over or haven't started

       * does not validate the number of items per order or the number of times an item can be included in an order

       * does not validate any requirements related to add-on products and does not add bundled products automatically

       * does not check prices but believes any prices you send

       * does not prevent you from buying items that can only be bought with a voucher

       * does not calculate fees automatically

       * does not allow to pass data to plugins and will therefore cause issues with some plugins like the shipping
         module

       * does not support file upload questions

       * does not support redeeming gift cards

       * does not support or validate memberships


   You can supply the following fields of the resource:

   * ``code`` (optional) – Only ``A-Z`` and ``0-9``, but without ``O`` and ``1``.
   * ``status`` (optional) – Defaults to pending for non-free orders and paid for free orders. You can only set this to
     ``"n"`` for pending or ``"p"`` for paid. We will create a payment object for this order either in state ``created``
     or in state ``confirmed``, depending on this value. If you create a paid order, the ``order_paid`` signal will
     **not** be sent out to plugins and no email will be sent. If you want that behavior, create an unpaid order and
     then call the ``mark_paid`` API method.
   * ``customer`` (optional) – Customer identifier or ``null``
   * ``testmode`` (optional) – Defaults to ``false``
   * ``consume_carts`` (optional) – A list of cart IDs. All cart positions with these IDs will be deleted if the
     order creation is successful. Any quotas or seats that become free by this operation will be credited to your order
     creation.
   * ``email`` (optional)
   * ``locale``
   * ``sales_channel`` (optional)
   * ``payment_provider`` (optional) – The identifier of the payment provider set for this order. This needs to be an
     existing payment provider. You should use ``"free"`` for free orders, and we strongly advise to use ``"manual"``
     for all orders you create as paid. This field is optional when the order status is ``"n"`` or the order total is
     zero, otherwise it is required.
   * ``payment_info`` (optional) – You can pass a nested JSON object that will be set as the internal ``info``
     value of the payment object that will be created. How this value is handled is up to the payment provider and you
     should only use this if you know the specific payment provider in detail. Please keep in mind that the payment
     provider will not be called to do anything about this (i.e. if you pass a bank account to a debit provider, *no*
     charge will be created), this is just informative in case you *handled the payment already*.
   * ``payment_date`` (optional) – Date and time of the completion of the payment.
   * ``comment`` (optional)
   * ``custom_followup_at`` (optional)
   * ``checkin_attention`` (optional)
   * ``checkin_text`` (optional)
   * ``require_approval`` (optional)
   * ``valid_if_pending`` (optional)
   * ``invoice_address`` (optional)

      * ``company``
      * ``is_business``
      * ``name`` **or** ``name_parts``
      * ``street``
      * ``zipcode``
      * ``city``
      * ``country``
      * ``state``
      * ``internal_reference``
      * ``vat_id``
      * ``vat_id_validated`` (optional) – If you need support for reverse charge (rarely the case), you need to check
       yourself if the passed VAT ID is a valid EU VAT ID. In that case, set this to ``true``. Only valid VAT IDs will
       trigger reverse charge taxation. Don't forget to set ``is_business`` as well!

   * ``positions``

      * ``positionid`` (optional, see below)
      * ``item``
      * ``variation`` (optional)
      * ``price`` (optional, if set to ``null`` or missing the price will be computed from the given product)
      * ``seat`` (The ``seat_guid`` attribute of a seat. Required when the specified ``item`` requires a seat, otherwise must be ``null``.)
      * ``attendee_name`` **or** ``attendee_name_parts`` (optional)
      * ``voucher`` (optional, the ``code`` attribute of a valid voucher)
      * ``attendee_email`` (optional)
      * ``company`` (optional)
      * ``street`` (optional)
      * ``zipcode`` (optional)
      * ``city`` (optional)
      * ``country`` (optional)
      * ``state`` (optional)
      * ``secret`` (optional)
      * ``addon_to`` (optional, see below)
      * ``subevent`` (optional)
      * ``valid_from`` (optional, if both ``valid_from`` and ``valid_until`` are **missing** (not ``null``) the availability will be computed from the given product)
      * ``valid_until`` (optional, if both ``valid_from`` and ``valid_until`` are **missing** (not ``null``) the availability will be computed from the given product)
      * ``requested_valid_from`` (optional, can be set **instead** of ``valid_from`` and ``valid_until`` to signal a user choice for the start time that may or may not be respected)
      * ``use_reusable_medium`` (optional, causes the new ticket to take over the given reusable medium, identified by its ID)
      * ``answers``

        * ``question``
        * ``answer``
        * ``options``

   * ``fees``

      * ``fee_type``
      * ``value``
      * ``description``
      * ``internal_type``
      * ``tax_rule``
      * ``_treat_value_as_percentage`` (Optional convenience flag. If set to ``true``, your ``value`` parameter will
        be treated as a percentage and the fee will be calculated using that percentage and the sum of all product
        prices. Note that this will not include other fees and is calculated once during order generation and will not
        be respected automatically when the order changes later.)
      * ``_split_taxes_like_products`` (Optional convenience flag. If set to ``true``, your ``tax_rule`` will be ignored
        and the fee will be taxed like the products in the order. If the products have multiple tax rates, multiple fees
        will be generated with weights adjusted to the net price of the products. Note that this will be calculated once
        during order generation and is not respected automatically when the order changes later.)

   * ``force`` (optional). If set to ``true``, quotas will be ignored.
   * ``send_email`` (optional). If set to ``true``, the same emails will be sent as for a regular order, regardless of
     whether these emails are enabled for certain sales channels. If set to ``null``, behavior will be controlled by pretix'
     settings based on the sales channels (added in pretix 4.7). Defaults to ``false``.
     Used to be ``send_mail`` before pretix 3.14.

   If you want to use add-on products, you need to set the ``positionid`` fields of all positions manually
   to incrementing integers starting with ``1``. Then, you can reference one of these
   IDs in the ``addon_to`` field of another position. Note that all add_ons for a specific position need to come
   immediately after the position itself.

   Starting with pretix 3.7, you can add ``"simulate": true`` to the body to do a "dry run" of your order. This will
   validate your order and return you an order object with the resulting prices, but will not create an actual order.
   You can use this for testing or to look up prices. In this case, some attributes are ignored, such as whether
   to send an email or what payment provider will be used. Note that some returned fields will contain empty values
   (e.g. all ``id`` fields of positions will be zero) and some will contain fake values (e.g. the order code will
   always be ``PREVIEW``). pretix plugins will not be triggered, so some special behavior might be missing as well.

        ...
      }

   :param organizer: The ``slug`` field of the organizer to modify
   :param event: The ``slug`` field of the event to modify
   :param code: The ``code`` field of the order to modify
   :statuscode 200: no error
   :statuscode 400: The order cannot be marked as paid, either because the current order status does not allow it or because no quota is left to perform the operation.
   :statuscode 401: Authentication failure
   :statuscode 403: The requested organizer/event does not exist **or** you have no permission to view this resource.
   :statuscode 404: The requested order does not exist.
   :statuscode 409: The server was unable to acquire a lock and could not process your request. You can try again after a short waiting period.

.. http:post:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/events/(event)/orders/(code)/mark_canceled/

   Cancels an order. For a pending order, this will set the order to status ``c``. For a paid order, this will set
   the order to status ``c`` if no ``cancellation_fee`` is passed. If you do pass a ``cancellation_fee``, the order
   will instead stay paid, but all positions will be removed (or marked as canceled) and replaced by the cancellation
   fee as the only component of the order.

   You can control whether the customer is notified through ``send_email`` (defaults to ``true``).
   You can pass a ``comment`` that can be visible to the user if it is used in the email template.

   **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

.. http:post:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/events/(event)/orders/(code)/extend/

   Extends the payment deadline of a pending order. If the order is already expired and quota is still
   available, its state will be changed to pending.

   The only required parameter of this operation is ``expires``, which should contain a date in the future.
   Note that only a date is expected, not a datetime, since pretix will always set the deadline to the end of the
   day in the event's timezone.

   You can pass the optional parameter ``force``. If it is set to ``true``, the operation will be performed even if
   it leads to an overbooked quota because the order was expired and the tickets have been sold again.

   .. sourcecode:: http

      POST /api/v1/organizers/bigevents/events/sampleconf/orders/ABC12/extend/ HTTP/1.1

.. _`order-position-ticket-download`:

Order position ticket download
------------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 4.10

   The API now supports ticket downloads for pending orders if allowed by the event settings.

.. http:get:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/events/(event)/orderpositions/(id)/download/(output)/

   Download tickets for one order position, identified by its internal ID.
   Depending on the chosen output, the response might be a ZIP file, PDF file or something else. The order details
   response contains a list of output options for this particular order position.

   Be aware that the output does not have to be a file, but can also be a regular HTTP response with a ``Content-Type``
   set to ``text/uri-list``. In this case, the user is expected to navigate to that URL in order to access their ticket.
   The referenced URL can provide a download or a regular, human-viewable website - so it is advised to open this URL
   in a webbrowser and leave it up to the user to handle the result.

   Tickets can only be downloaded if ticket downloads are active and – depending on event settings – the order is either paid or pending. Also, depending on event
   configuration downloads might be only unavailable for add-on products or non-admission products.
   Note that in some cases the ticket file might not yet have been created. In that case, you will receive a status
   code :http:statuscode:`409` and you are expected to retry the request after a short period of waiting.

   **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      GET /api/v1/organizers/bigevents/events/sampleconf/orderpositions/23442/download/pdf/ HTTP/1.1
      Host: pretix.eu
      Accept: application/json, text/javascript

   **Example response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Vary: Accept
      Content-Type: application/pdf

      ...

   :param organizer: The ``slug`` field of the organizer to fetch
   :param event: The ``slug`` field of the event to fetch
   :param id: The ``id`` field of the order position to fetch
   :param output: The internal name of the output provider to use
   :statuscode 200: no error
   :statuscode 401: Authentication failure
   :statuscode 403: The requested organizer/event does not exist **or** you have no permission to view this resource
                    **or** downloads are not available for this order position at this time. The response content will
                    contain more details.
   :statuscode 404: The requested order position or download provider does not exist.
   :statuscode 409: The file is not yet ready and will now be prepared. Retry the request after waiting for a few
                    seconds.

.. _rest-orderpositions-manipulate:

Manipulating individual positions
---------------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 4.8

   The ``PATCH`` method now supports changing items, variations, subevents, seats, prices, and tax rules.
   The ``POST`` endpoint to add individual positions has been added.

.. versionadded:: 4.16

   The endpoints to manage blocks have been added.

.. http:patch:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/events/(event)/orderpositions/(id)/

   Updates specific fields on an order position. Currently, only the following fields are supported:

   * ``attendee_email``

   * ``attendee_name_parts`` or ``attendee_name``

   * ``company``

   * ``street``

   * ``zipcode``

   * ``city``

   * ``country``

   * ``state``

   * ``answers``: If specified, you will need to provide **all** answers for this order position.
     Validation is handled the same way as when creating orders through the API. You are therefore
     expected to provide ``question``, ``answer``, and possibly ``options``. ``question_identifier``
     and ``option_identifiers`` will be ignored. As a special case, you can submit the magic value
     ``"file:keep"`` as the answer to a file question to keep the current value without re-uploading it.

   * ``item``

   * ``variation``

   * ``subevent``

   * ``seat`` (specified as a string mapping to a ``string_guid``)

   * ``price``

   * ``tax_rule``

   * ``valid_from``

   * ``valid_until``

   Changing parameters such as ``item`` or ``price`` will **not** automatically trigger creation of a new invoice,
   you need to take care of that yourself.

   **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      PATCH /api/v1/organizers/bigevents/events/sampleconf/orderpositions/23442/ HTTP/1.1

   :statuscode 403: The requested organizer/event does not exist **or** you have no permission to update this order.

.. http:post:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/events/(event)/orderpositions/

   Adds a new position to an order. Currently, only the following fields are supported:

   * ``order`` (mandatory, specified as a string mapping to a ``code``)

   * ``addon_to`` (optional, specified as an integer mapping to the ``positionid`` of the parent position)

   * ``item`` (mandatory)

   * ``variation`` (mandatory depending on item)

   * ``subevent`` (mandatory depending on event)

   * ``seat`` (specified as a string mapping to a ``string_guid``, mandatory depending on event and item)

   * ``price`` (default price will be used if unset)

   * ``attendee_email``

   * ``attendee_name_parts`` or ``attendee_name``

   * ``company``

   * ``street``

   * ``zipcode``

   * ``city``

   * ``country``

   * ``state``

   * ``answers``: Validation is handled the same way as when creating orders through the API. You are therefore
     expected to provide ``question``, ``answer``, and possibly ``options``. ``question_identifier``
     and ``option_identifiers`` will be ignored. As a special case, you can submit the magic value
     ``"file:keep"`` as the answer to a file question to keep the current value without re-uploading it.

   * ``valid_from``

Changing order contents
-----------------------

While you can :ref:`change positions individually <rest-orderpositions-manipulate>` sometimes it is necessary to make
multiple changes to an order at once within one transaction. This makes it possible to e.g. swap the seats of two
attendees in an order without running into conflicts. This interface also offers some possibilities not available
otherwise, such as splitting an order or changing fees.

.. versionchanged:: 4.8

   This endpoint has been added to the system.

.. http:post:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/events/(event)/orders/(code)/change/

   Performs a change operation on an order. You can supply the following fields:

   * ``patch_positions``: A list of objects with the two keys ``position`` specifying an order position ID and
     ``body`` specifying the desired changed values of the position (``item``, ``variation``, ``subevent``, ``seat``,
     ``price``, ``tax_rule``, ``valid_from``, ``valid_until``).

   * ``cancel_positions``: A list of objects with the single key ``position`` specifying an order position ID.

   * ``split_positions``: A list of objects with the single key ``position`` specifying an order position ID.

   * ``create_positions``: A list of objects describing new order positions with the same fields supported as when
     creating them individually through the ``POST …/orderpositions/`` endpoint.

   * ``patch_fees``: A list of objects with the two keys ``fee`` specifying an order fee ID and
     ``body`` specifying the desired changed values of the position (``value``).

   * ``cancel_fees``: A list of objects with the single key ``fee`` specifying an order fee ID.

   * ``recalculate_taxes``: If set to ``"keep_net"``, all taxes will be recalculated based on the tax rule and invoice
     address, the net price will be kept. If set to ``"keep_gross"``, the gross price will be kept. If set to ``null``
     (the default) the taxes are not recalculated.

   * ``send_email``: If set to ``true``, the customer will be notified about the change. Defaults to ``false``.

   * ``reissue_invoice``: If set to ``true`` and an invoice exists for the order, it will be canceled and a new invoice
     will be issued. Defaults to ``true``.

.. http:post:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/events/(event)/orders/(code)/payments/

   Creates a new payment.

   Be careful with the ``info`` parameter: You can pass a nested JSON object that will be set as the internal ``info``
   value of the payment object that will be created. How this value is handled is up to the payment provider and you
   should only use this if you know the specific payment provider in detail. Please keep in mind that the payment
   provider will not be called to do anything about this (i.e. if you pass a bank account to a debit provider, *no*
   charge will be created), this is just informative in case you *handled the payment already*.
