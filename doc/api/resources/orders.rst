Creating orders
---------------

.. http:post:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/events/(event)/orders/

   Creates a new order.

   .. warning::

       This endpoint is intended for advanced users. It is not designed to be used to build your own shop frontend,
       it's rather intended to import attendees from external sources etc.
       There is a lot that it does not or can not do, and you will need to be careful using it.
       It allows to bypass many of the restrictions imposed when creating an order through the
       regular shop.

       Specifically, this endpoint currently

       * does not validate if products are only to be sold in a specific time frame

       * does not validate if products are only to be sold on other sales channels

       * does not validate if the event's ticket sales are already over or haven't started

       * does not validate the number of items per order or the number of times an item can be included in an order

       * does not validate any requirements related to add-on products and does not add bundled products automatically

       * does not check prices but believes any prices you send

       * does not prevent you from buying items that can only be bought with a voucher

       * does not calculate fees automatically

       * does not allow to pass data to plugins and will therefore cause issues with some plugins like the shipping
         module

       * does not support file upload questions

       * does not support redeeming gift cards

   You can supply the following fields of the resource:

   * ``code`` (optional)
   * ``status`` (optional) – Defaults to pending for non-free orders and paid for free orders. You can only set this to
     ``"n"`` for pending or ``"p"`` for paid. We will create a payment object for this order either in state ``created``
     or in state ``confirmed``, depending on this value. If you create a paid order, the ``order_paid`` signal will
     **not** be sent out to plugins and no email will be sent. If you want that behavior, create an unpaid order and
     then call the ``mark_paid`` API method.
   * ``testmode`` (optional) – Defaults to ``false``
   * ``consume_carts`` (optional) – A list of cart IDs. All cart positions with these IDs will be deleted if the
     order creation is successful. Any quotas or seats that become free by this operation will be credited to your order
     creation.
   * ``email``
   * ``locale``
   * ``sales_channel``
   * ``payment_provider`` (optional) – The identifier of the payment provider set for this order. This needs to be an
     existing payment provider. You should use ``"free"`` for free orders, and we strongly advise to use ``"manual"``
     for all orders you create as paid. This field is optional when the order status is ``"n"`` or the order total is
     zero, otherwise it is required.
   * ``payment_info`` (optional) – You can pass a nested JSON object that will be set as the internal ``info``
     value of the payment object that will be created. How this value is handled is up to the payment provider and you
     should only use this if you know the specific payment provider in detail. Please keep in mind that the payment
     provider will not be called to do anything about this (i.e. if you pass a bank account to a debit provider, *no*
     charge will be created), this is just informative in case you *handled the payment already*.
   * ``payment_date`` (optional) – Date and time of the completion of the payment.
   * ``comment`` (optional)
   * ``checkin_attention`` (optional)
   * ``invoice_address`` (optional)

      * ``company``
      * ``is_business``
      * ``name`` **or** ``name_parts``
      * ``street``
      * ``zipcode``
      * ``city``
      * ``country``
      * ``state``
      * ``internal_reference``
      * ``vat_id``
      * ``vat_id_validated`` (optional) – If you need support for reverse charge (rarely the case), you need to check
       yourself if the passed VAT ID is a valid EU VAT ID. In that case, set this to ``true``. Only valid VAT IDs will
       trigger reverse charge taxation. Don't forget to set ``is_business`` as well!

   * ``positions``

      * ``positionid`` (optional, see below)
      * ``item``
      * ``variation``
      * ``price`` (optional, if set to ``null`` or missing the price will be computed from the given product)
      * ``seat`` (The ``seat_guid`` attribute of a seat. Required when the specified ``item`` requires a seat, otherwise must be ``null``.)
      * ``attendee_name`` **or** ``attendee_name_parts``
      * ``voucher`` (optional, the ``code`` attribute of a valid voucher)
      * ``attendee_email``
      * ``secret`` (optional)
      * ``addon_to`` (optional, see below)
      * ``subevent``
      * ``answers``

        * ``question``
        * ``answer``
        * ``options``

   * ``fees``

      * ``fee_type``
      * ``value``
      * ``description``
      * ``internal_type``
      * ``tax_rule``

   * ``force`` (optional). If set to ``true``, quotas will be ignored.
   * ``send_mail`` (optional). If set to ``true``, the same emails will be sent as for a regular order. Defaults to
     ``false``.

   If you want to use add-on products, you need to set the ``positionid`` fields of all positions manually
   to incrementing integers starting with ``1``. Then, you can reference one of these
   IDs in the ``addon_to`` field of another position. Note that all add_ons for a specific position need to come
   immediately after the position itself.

.. http:post:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/events/(event)/orders/(code)/mark_canceled/

   Cancels an order. For a pending order, this will set the order to status ``c``. For a paid order, this will set
   the order to status ``c`` if no ``cancellation_fee`` is passed. If you do pass a ``cancellation_fee``, the order
   will instead stay paid, but all positions will be removed (or marked as canceled) and replaced by the cancellation
   fee as the only component of the order.

.. http:post:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/events/(event)/orders/(code)/extend/

   Extends the payment deadline of a pending order. If the order is already expired and quota is still
   available, its state will be changed to pending.

   The only required parameter of this operation is ``expires``, which should contain a date in the future.
   Note that only a date is expected, not a datetime, since pretix will always set the deadline to the end of the
   day in the event's timezone.

   You can pass the optional parameter ``force``. If it is set to ``true``, the operation will be performed even if
   it leads to an overbooked quota because the order was expired and the tickets have been sold again.

.. _`order-position-ticket-download`:

Order position ticket download
------------------------------

.. http:get:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/events/(event)/orderpositions/(id)/download/(output)/

   Download tickets for one order position, identified by its internal ID.
   Depending on the chosen output, the response might be a ZIP file, PDF file or something else. The order details
   response contains a list of output options for this particular order position.

   Be aware that the output does not have to be a file, but can also be a regular HTTP response with a ``Content-Type``
   set to ``text/uri-list``. In this case, the user is expected to navigate to that URL in order to access their ticket.
   The referenced URL can provide a download or a regular, human-viewable website - so it is advised to open this URL
   in a webbrowser and leave it up to the user to handle the result.

   Tickets can be only downloaded if the order is paid and if ticket downloads are active. Also, depending on event
   configuration downloads might be only unavailable for add-on products or non-admission products.
   Note that in some cases the ticket file might not yet have been created. In that case, you will receive a status
   code :http:statuscode:`409` and you are expected to retry the request after a short period of waiting.

   **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      GET /api/v1/organizers/bigevents/events/sampleconf/orderpositions/23442/download/pdf/ HTTP/1.1

   :statuscode 200: no error
   :statuscode 401: Authentication failure
   :statuscode 403: The requested organizer/event does not exist **or** you have no permission to view this resource
                    **or** downloads are not available for this order position at this time. The response content will
                    contain more details.
   :statuscode 404: The requested order position or download provider does not exist.
   :statuscode 409: The file is not yet ready and will now be prepared. Retry the request after waiting for a few
                    seconds.
