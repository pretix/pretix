Notes
-----

Please note that an item either always has variations or never has. Once created with variations the item can never
change to an item without and vice versa. To create an item with variations ensure that you POST an item with at least
one variation.

Also note that ``variations``, ``bundles``, and  ``addons`` are only supported on ``POST``. To update/delete variations,
bundles, and add-ons please use the dedicated nested endpoints. By design this endpoint does not support ``PATCH`` and ``PUT``
with nested ``variations``, ``bundles`` and/or ``addons``.

   you need to update/delete variations or add-ons please use the nested dedicated endpoints.
