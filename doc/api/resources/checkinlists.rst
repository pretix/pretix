Check-in lists
==============

Resource description
--------------------

You can create check-in lists that you can use e.g. at the entrance of your event to track who is coming and if they
actually bought a ticket.

You can create multiple check-in lists to separate multiple parts of your event, for example if you have separate
entries for multiple ticket types. Different check-in lists are completely independent: If a ticket shows up on two
lists, it is valid once on every list. This might be useful if you run a festival with festival passes that allow
access to every or multiple performances as well as tickets only valid for single performances.

The check-in list resource contains the following public fields:

.. rst-class:: rest-resource-table

name                                  string                     The internal name of the check-in list
all_products                          boolean                    If ``true``, the check-in lists contains tickets of all products in this event. The ``limit_products`` field is ignored in this case.
limit_products                        list of integers           List of item IDs to include in this list.
subevent                              integer                    ID of the date inside an event series this list belongs to (or ``null``).

include_pending                       boolean                    If ``true``, the check-in list also contains tickets from orders in pending state.
auto_checkin_sales_channels           list of strings            All items on the check-in list will be automatically marked as checked-in when purchased through any of the listed sales channels.

.. http:patch:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/events/(event)/checkinlists/(id)/

   Update a check-in list. You can also use ``PUT`` instead of ``PATCH``. With ``PUT``, you have to provide all fields of
   the resource, other fields will be reset to default. With ``PATCH``, you only need to provide the fields that you
   want to change.

   You can change all fields of the resource except the ``id`` field and the ``checkin_count`` and ``position_count``
   fields.

Order position endpoints
------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 1.15

   The order positions endpoint has been extended by the filter queries ``item__in``, ``variation__in``,
   ``order__status__in``, ``subevent__in``, ``addon_to__in``, and ``search``. The search for attendee names and order
   codes is now case-insensitive.

   The ``.../redeem/`` endpoint has been added.

.. versionchanged:: 2.0

   The order positions endpoint has been extended by the filter queries ``voucher`` and ``voucher__code``.

.. versionchanged:: 2.7

   The resource now contains the new attributes ``require_attention`` and ``order__status`` and accepts the new
   ``ignore_status`` filter. The ``attendee_name`` field is now "smart" (see below) and the redemption endpoint
   returns ``400`` instead of ``404`` on tickets which are known but not paid.

.. versionchanged:: 3.2

    The ``checkins`` dict now also contains a ``auto_checked_in`` value to indicate if the check-in has been performed
    automatically by the system.

.. http:get:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/events/(event)/checkinlists/(list)/positions/

   Returns a list of all order positions within a given event. The result is the same as
   the :ref:`order-position-resource`, with the following differences:

   * The ``checkins`` value will only include check-ins for the selected list.

   * An additional boolean property ``require_attention`` will inform you whether either the order or the item
     have the ``checkin_attention`` flag set.

   * If ``attendee_name`` is empty, it will automatically fall back to values from a parent product or from invoice
     addresses.

.. http:post:: /api/v1/organizers/(organizer)/events/(event)/checkinlists/(list)/positions/(id)/redeem/

   Tries to redeem an order position, identified by its internal ID, i.e. checks the attendee in. This endpoint
   accepts a number of optional requests in the body.

   **Instead of an ID, you can also use the ``secret`` field as the lookup parameter.**

   :<json boolean questions_supported: When this parameter is set to ``true``, handling of questions is supported. If
                                       you do not implement question handling in your user interface, you **must**
                                       set this to ``false``. In that case, questions will just be ignored. Defaults
                                       to ``true``.
   :<json boolean canceled_supported: When this parameter is set to ``true``, the response code ``canceled`` may be
                                      returned. Otherwise, canceled orders will return ``unpaid``.
   :<json datetime datetime: Specifies the datetime of the check-in. If not supplied, the current time will be used.
   :<json boolean force: Specifies that the check-in should succeed regardless of previous check-ins or required
                         questions that have not been filled. Defaults to ``false``.
   :<json boolean ignore_unpaid: Specifies that the check-in should succeed even if the order is in pending state.
                                 Defaults to ``false`` and only works when ``include_pending`` is set on the check-in
                                 list.
   :<json string nonce: You can set this parameter to a unique random value to identify this check-in. If you're sending
                        this request twice with the same nonce, the second request will also succeed but will always
                        create only one check-in object even when the previous request was successful as well. This
                        allows for a certain level of idempotency and enables you to re-try after a connection failure.
   :<json object answers: If questions are supported/required, you may/must supply a mapping of question IDs to their
                          respective answers. The answers should always be strings. In case of (multiple-)choice-type
                          answers, the string should contain the (comma-separated) IDs of the selected options.

     ``canceled_supported`` to ``true``, otherwise these orders return ``unpaid``.
   * ``already_redeemed`` - Ticket already has been redeemed
   * ``product`` - Tickets with this product may not be scanned at this device
