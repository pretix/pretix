"""
This module provides a safer version of openpyxl's `Workbook` class to generate XLSX files from
user-generated data using `WriteOnlyWorksheet` and `ws.append()`. We commonly use these methods
to output e.g. order data, which contains data from untrusted sources such as attendee names.

There are mainly two problems this solves:

- It makes sure strings starting with = are treated as text, not as a formula, as openpyxl will
  otherwise assume, which can be used for remote code execution.

- It removes characters considered invalid by Excel to avoid exporter crashes.
