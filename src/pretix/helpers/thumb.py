# How "size" works:


## normal resize

image|thumb:"100x100" resizes the image proportionally to a maximum width and maximum height of 100px.
I.e. an image of 200x100 will be resized to 100x50.
An image of 40x80 will stay 40x80.


## cropped resize with ^

image|thumb:"100x100^" resizes the image proportionally to a minimum width and minimum height of 100px and then will be cropped to 100x100.
I.e. an image of 300x200 will be resized to 150x100 and then cropped from center to 100x100.
An image of 40x80 will stay 40x80.


## exact-size resize with _

exact-size-operator "_" works for width and height independently, so the following is possible:

image|thumb:"100_x100" resizes the image to a maximum height of 100px (if it is lower, it does not upscale) and makes it exactly 100px wide
(if the resized image would be less than 100px wide it adds a white background to both sides to make it at least 100px wide).
I.e. an image of 300x200 will be resized to 150x100.
An image of 40x80 will stay 40x80 but padded with a white background to be 100x80.

image|thumb:"100x100_" resizes the image to a maximum width of 100px (if it is lower, it does not upscale) and makes it at least 100px high
(if the resized image would be less than 100px high it adds a white background to top and bottom to make it at least 100px high).
I.e. an image of 400x200 will be resized to 100x50 and then padded from center to be 100x100.
An image of 40x80 will stay 40x80 but padded with a white background to be 40x100.

image|thumb:"100_x100_" resizes the image proportionally to either a width or height of 100px â€“ it takes the smaller side and resizes that to 100px,
so the longer side will at least be 100px. So the resulting image will at least be 100px wide and at least 100px high. If the original image is bigger
than 100x100 then no padding will occur. If the original image is smaller than 100x100, no resize will happen but padding to 100x100 will occur.
I.e. an image of 400x200 will be resized to 200x100.
An image of 40x80 will stay 40x80 but padded with a white background to be 100x100.
