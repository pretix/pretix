    """
    This is an attempt to build a simple "fair-use" policy for webhooks and notifications. The problem is that when
    one organizer creates e.g. 20,000 orders through the API, that might schedule 20,000 webhooks and every other
    organizer will need to wait for these webhooks to go through.

    We try to fix that by building three queues: high-prio, mid-prio, and low-prio. Every organizer starts in the
    high-prio queue, and all their tasks are routed immediately. Once an organizer submits more than X jobs of a
    certain type per minute, they get downgraded to the mid-prio queue, and then – if they submit even more – to the
    low-prio queue. That way, if another organizer has "regular usage", they are prioritized over the organizer with
    high load.
