Reinventing ticket presales, one ticket at a time.

Project status & release cycle
------------------------------

While there is always a lot to do and improve on, pretix by now has been in use for more than a dozen
conferences that sold over ten thousand tickets combined without major problems. We therefore think of
pretix as being stable and ready to use.

If you want to use or extend pretix, we strongly recommend to follow our `blog`_. We will announce all
releases there. You can always find the latest stable version on PyPI or in the ``release/X.Y`` branch of
this repository. The ``master`` branch contains a development version that we also try to keep stable in
the sense that it does not break your data,  but its APIs might change without prior notice.

To get started using pretix on your own server, look at the `installation guide`_ in our documentation.

This project is 100 percent free and open source software. If you are interested in commercial support,
hosting services or supporting this project financially, please go to `pretix.eu`_ or contact us at
support@pretix.eu.
