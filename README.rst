Reinventing ticket presales, one ticket at a time.

Project status & release cycle
------------------------------

While there is always a lot to do and improve on, pretix by now has been in use for thousands of events
conferences that sold millions of tickets combined. We therefore think of pretix as being stable and ready to use.

If you want to use or extend pretix, we strongly recommend to follow our `blog`_. We will announce all
releases there. You can always find the latest stable version on PyPI or in the ``release/X.Y`` branch of
this repository. The ``master`` branch contains a development version that we also try to keep stable in
the sense that it does not break your data,  but its APIs might change without prior notice.

To get started using pretix on your own server, look at the `installation guide`_ in our documentation.
